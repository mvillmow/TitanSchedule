Fix CI failures for PR $ARGUMENTS.

1. Get the PR number (use $ARGUMENTS or detect from current branch if empty)
2. Check CI status: `gh pr checks <pr>`
3. If failing, get failed run logs: `gh run view <run-id> --log-failed`
4. Identify the failing test/build step
5. Read the relevant source files
6. Fix the issue
7. Run tests locally: `pixi run test`
8. Commit and push the fix
9. Wait for CI and verify it passes

If multiple PRs provided, fix each one sequentially.
